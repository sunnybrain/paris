The local artisans and sketch artists will approach you - they are persuasive, but as an artist the last thing I need is a portrait of myself. Still, support the locals in your own way. ",

This was truly the highlight of our trip and offered such a unique, intimate way to see the city. I felt like I fell in love with Paris the moment we hopped on our adorable pistachio and cherry red Vespa's to go explore.",

The history resonates walking La Seine... you feel the Medieval darkness to the Renaissance light. You cry for the eternal ashes of Jeanne d'Arc.",
